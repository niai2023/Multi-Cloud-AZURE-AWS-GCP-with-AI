#### ✅ How Cloud Solves These Problems:

| Feature         | Traditional IT   | Cloud Computing              |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 💸 Cost         | High CAPEX       | Pay-as-you-go (OPEX)         |
| 🚀 Speed        | Slow setup       | Instant provisioning         |
| 📈 Scalability  | Fixed capacity   | Auto-scaling on demand       |
| 🌍 Availability | Local only       | Global access, 99.99% uptime |
| 🛡️ Backup & DR | Manual & complex | Built-in & automated         |
| 🔄 Updates      | Manual           | Continuous & automated       |
